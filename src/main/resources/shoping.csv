 on 6 April 2014 // Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year, even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By

 on 26 May 2015 // Simple & GREAT FUN for 5+My nephews face was amazing when he opened this for his birthday!! His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

Adults and kids collectively enjoy its appearance from around the Christmas tree.Whilst I use this as effectively a Christmas tree decoration it is nevertheless a quality Hornby OO gauge model in its own right, and could be used year round for a modelling enthusiast.A word of warning would be that the model is delicate and intricate. If you have cats for example they are sure to damage the delicate parts as they seek to derail the train from the track. | and I absolutely love it.

 on 13 Nov. 2011 // My 2 year old loves chuggington so we decided to get her this set. To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not, i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way, but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it, there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. | Excellent entertainment set // 5.0 // 11 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 12 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach, with a pair of white horses, and two figures on the (red) driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat, the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside, but if you look through the back window, these are heads visible. This is a striking model, and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one.

Each Chuggington friend talks, reacts and interacts realistically with the Chuggington Interactive World. Each smart engine recognizes any other engine, reacts to any train stop and responds to your play. Engines recognise and ""magically"" talk to each other, trainig stops and set accessories.Brewster is a solid diesel-electric train built for heavy loads. He doesn’t always understand his own strength, which can make him a bit awkward and clumsy. He is very dependable and can always be relied on in a crisis--a tower of strength.

 on 9 July 2011 // Got these for my 2 yr old - he's obsessed with trains and loves these characters. They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he can't get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint, it's a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However, this won't be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on, but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other, he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) | Fabulous toy // 5.0 // 2 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Oct. 2014 // This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender, and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets, there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they don't seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing, but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight, and it all slots together easily. There is also a ""trackmat"" supplied, which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout, to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse, but it's all you need to get started. (If you get keen, you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - it's reasonably obvious how you assemble it all, which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem, as most bits will only fit one way!Read more › | The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it // 4.0 // 3 Dec. 2015 // By

    Mr. JB Smedley

 on 3 Dec. 2015 // A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it, and for a ""railroad"" model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at, and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included, while a fairly minimal amount, is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger, it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly, and I can't wait to see it running on a much larger layout! | Good starter for the enthusiast // 5.0 // 1 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Oct. 2014 // This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras, to get the best out of it. As a starting point, it's great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat, solid base. You'll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm ""MidiMat"" too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages, with their white `table cloths' and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it, as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included, to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting, but that's almost £100, so far, and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh, and you'll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat, R8217, to go with packs E and F.Then you'll want to add accessories such as stations, signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don't imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track, the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for 'fun'.Some parts, notably some of the couplings, seem rather fragile. I wouldn't recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum, and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more › | A good starter set. // 4.0 // 19 Jan. 2015 // By

    William Wade

 on 19 Jan. 2015 // This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit ""flashy"", they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.",

With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs.

It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue.

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 14 July 2014 // This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery, with a black roof. It is a bogie vehicle with end vestibule doors and two sliding doors each side, with a guard's compartment fitted with a `birdcage' roof at one end. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows and sliding doors (unfortunately, so can one of the screw-fittings for a bogie). The running number is PPu 17660, and there is a destination board for a Munchen to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a beautifully detailed model, as you would expect from Trix, and is of a high quality of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""bw bahn"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£36.51""}}"

With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980's. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches.

 on 20 Nov. 2013 // I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. | Excellent introduction  to the hobby. // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 26 Oct. 2014 // Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And,  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot, that's OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone, whilst building titchy windmills).It's nice to see, after not handling  a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this  set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. | Great starter set, but do your research // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 3 Jan. 2015 // My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6), as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""KNC Toys"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£65.00""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£69.99""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£79.95""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£80.48""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""CLIFFORD JAMES"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£79.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Frome Models Centre"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£89.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""TrainStop"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£91.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Models & Computers Plus"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£92.99""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""GamesQuest"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£104.99""}]}"

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 30 Jun. 2014 // This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery, with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach, with a steel chassis, and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina' connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating, and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window, and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture, with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£34.95""}}"

 on 30 Dec. 2013 // I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed, even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. | This is not a toy! // 4.0 // 3 Feb. 2013 // By

 on 21 May 2015 // Easy to install, either by slotting directly into OO gauge track or by joining wires to holes in the base plate of the signal. Easy to set-up, just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads, distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout, so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life. | Easy bit with placement limitations // 3.0 // 12 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 8 Oct. 2015 // Good little train set, something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane, which you can get in a 'steam era' rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course, that doesn't match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that won't matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it won't tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme, like a general shunting train, as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this, but it's low priced so it stays at 5.The controller, track, wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset, especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... | Great set // 5.0 // 16 April 2015 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2016 // Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track, and a midi mat. The mat is paper, so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping, and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails, so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 9 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 18 Dec. 2014 // This is an excellent kit that has been around for more than fifty years . Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can , however , be rectified with care and despite this , the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless , motorised , working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR 'City' class loco but determined 'kitbashers' can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century .

 on 23 Aug. 2014 // This particular model kit has its origins a half-century ago. and people have converted them, with a lot of skilled work, to run on OO-gauge model railways. As a static model, it needs careful work. It will reward extra effort. This isn't for the beginner. It has to lose a star because the manufacturing standards have improved. A modern kit could be so much better. But one day there just won't be any more of this model.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£10.20""}}"

 on 27 Feb. 2015 // Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can't go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I've docked a star.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£12.30""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Emmasaurus Shop"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£17.25""}]}"

 on 8 Aug. 2014 // These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars, built in the 1930's, survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries, crimson and cream, maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960's.  I've given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon one's 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E, whilst the one depicted here, E9131E, lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and, whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables, you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It's a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging, an (empty) transparent sandwich display case, what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though, presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches, over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There's also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as I'm aware) in the beers department.Read more › | Five Stars // 5.0 // 5 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 24 Aug. 2010 // The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! | Wheels to the rails! // 4.0 // 22 April 2011 // By

 on 22 April 2011 // My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them, so promised him one for his birthday, then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks, which are rather fiddly to set up (grown-ups have to do this) and he doesn't seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand, it tends to lift off the tracks so I'm constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However, the toys are very sturdy, the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment (I do take them away if he gets too boisterous).The trains are beautifully made - bright, sturdy, cheerful and just like their TV counterparts, with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative, interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them, and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains, although disappointingly, only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance, for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room, so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash (he saw it on the side of the box) so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more › | My son loves this // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2010 // By

He loves it so much i've just bought the straigh& curved track and the extra level track to make it even more enjoyable... what i love most about this is that you can buy so many things to add on, so for easter i'll get him more for the track so he'll never get bored.I along with the othe person's review thought the trains would automatically interact with each other but my son is getting used to pressing the buttons more now so it's not so bad, i think for a younger child they wouldn't get as much fun from the interactive part.On the whole I would definately recommend this product... have fun chugging everyone xxx | What an excellent toy // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By

 on 23 April 2014 // I bought this (with an extra Wilson loco) for my very bright two year old grandson over 18 months ago.  It has easily been his all-time favourite toy and he always wants to play with it when he visits.  The larger size of the locos are just the right size for him to play with by himself and and the interactive noises keep him interested for ages.  The track must have been set out and taken up over 100 hundred times now, but everything still works perfectly with absolutely no broken parts (which I find amazing). | This a really good point and we're just got what we wanted // 5.0 // 6 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 27 Dec. 2013 // Have to be honest i genuinly expected the engines to move themselves. Judging by the fact the engines are twice the size of the standard ones, and why put a non slip type surface on the slopes when their to be pushed by hand ? I bought 3 different sets to build a larger layout, and not a hand in site on any of the pictures !Quality of the track and engines and extras very good, but the technology to make them move is not new , and would have been so simple and easy to install as they need batteries anyway. | let's interact.... but only if you push the button!! // 4.0 // 24 Aug. 2010 // By

Recommended. // 4.0 // 15 April 2015 // By

    Antony Dalton

 on 15 April 2015 // A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family (from 2-5 years old).  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily, and is well finished, so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars. | Good set for the price. // 4.0 // 26 May 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 31 May 2014 // This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery, with a grey-green roof. It is a short four-wheeled vehicle with smooth flat sides, and two end platforms. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows. The running number is Munchen PpostL 21029.This model is fitted with the standard ‘loop’ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with the usual transparent plasticky internal packaging, but with only a base and two folding-up end-pieces, no top.This is a beautifully detailed model, as you would expect from Trix, with some fine details already in place, but there is a packet of delicate bits for you to add. It is of a high quality of manufacture.Note that I paid £32 for my model, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops – or even a distant one.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""bw bahn"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£27.40""}}"

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 22 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon with a seated driver and various sacks inside, and with two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model, and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £14 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Smaller World Future"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£137.16""}}"

Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800,000 debt from the project, which cost around £3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder. Once this decoder is fitted it is ready to use on a DCC layout.

 on 30 April 2011 // I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play, without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine, as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas, Spencer, Percy, Diesel, Toby,and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines, making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him, and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment, I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc, I find myself sometimes going through products for an age, or going to other sites, to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service, but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier.

My 5 year old was desperate to have his own proper train set and I was concerned over getting one of the >£100 sets so this fit the bill. The track mat is a great idea and didn't take long to assemble it all.My only problem was with the controller. Everytime there was a derailment, the controller would stop working for about 1 minute, one of it's safety features. I gave up with it in the end and got a better one off the Internet. | MY NEPHEW LOVES IT // 4.0 // 9 Aug. 2013 // By

 on 13 April 2013 // This a really accurate model of the Brighton Belle as it first appeared in 1932. It's detail correct up until about 1952 when new bogies were used to help improve the ride and the second(third) class Pullmans changed their logo to simply ""Car No.88"" etc.I have bought the full 5 car set using matching coaches also made by Hornby. The Hornby list price is right for what you get but my budget doesn't go that far so I've shopped around and found absolute bargains both on amazon and ebay sites as sellers discount their stock to get a quick sale.The train itself runs very well and although there is only one power bogie it is more than adequate to pull the whole 5 car train up the 1 in 30 inclines on my layout.The chassis is made of metal which gives extra adhesion but the real key to this is how Hornby have arranged the power collection for the lighting to run from the power car itself through the couplings to all the cars rather than collect it from each of the carriages' bogies. This way there is no additional friction at all from pick-ups which might reduce power.It runs perfectly well in either direction even though the power bogie is in one of the end driving cars.Well done Hornby and well done amazon for providing the market place where sellers can provide the discount I need.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Howleys Toy Shop"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£166.04""}}"

 on 18 April 2012 // I bought this for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Thomas and the Trackmaster collection. He absolutly loves the day of the diesels film, so I got him this train, along with Den, Dart and Bell. Its still great fun like all previous trackmaster trains, and is fantastic for any child who loves playing with trains. I think its great for developing imaginative play too, as he now makes the ""diesels"" and ""steamies"" role play and talk, and we've painted an old box to make a diesel works. He absolutly loves diesel 10 and takes him everywhere. The only criticism I would have is that he requires a C cell battery, which I have to replace every 2-3 days, but this is probably because my son literally plays with him from the moment he gets up to the time he goes to bed! | Not fit for purpose! // 1.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2012 // TrackMaster should redesign this toy.  I gave it to my grandson on Christmas Day.  He had been asking to have a Diesel 10 for months and was so pleased when he opened it.  The battery does not stay in place.  Any jolt or movement dislodges the battery which has only the metal connections to each end holding it in a large space.  We tried packing it with card but in the end playdough all round the battery filling the cavity held it in place so he could play with it.It is so disappointing for children when new toys don't work.

This is a very modern style of side-corridor coach, with end-vestibule entrances and ‘concertina’ connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating (which differs slightly from the 1st and 2nd class coaches), and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is CCu 13017, and the destination board is for a Munich to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard ‘loop’ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches, along with a baggage car.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""bw bahn"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£41.87""}}"

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 23 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a high-sided blue heavy wooden wagon, with a driver standing inside it, and two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model, and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I paid £12 for my model, so it can be worth shopping around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Au Pullman"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£20.21""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""tablet_books"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£40.99""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""francejouet"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£53.15""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Sam Store US"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£90.35""}]}"

A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

#1 HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 24 Oct. 2013 // This product is designed as a scale model for adult collectors - it is not a toy for children and the Amazon category should reflect that.However, turning to the actual product - the Sir Nigel Gresley, A4 Pacific Class Locomotive model which is supplied with tender - it is a nicely presented scale model which is highly detailed in terms of paintwork, wheels, pistons and piping etc.  The amount of work that must have gone into producing this model is significant and it has resulted in a good quality model, especially in view of the price. I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case, in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldn't really ask for more, and, if like me, you are short of space, the 1:120 scale is ideal. Recommended. | Loved this product // 5.0 // 13 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!), the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! | LNER'S Flying Scotsman. // 4.0 // 3 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set, I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches, oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A,B,C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Especially as discounted by Amazon, this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models, or of some of the others in the market, e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality, but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard, and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It's really disappointing to find that it's many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. | Better than expected // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2012 // Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly, the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! | Boyhood dream fulfilled - after fifty years!

From 1953 to 1962, 996 locomotives were produced, making it the most numerous of all British locomotive classes. As the standard general-purpose diesel shunter on BR, almost any duty requiring shunting would involve a Class 08. The class became a familiar sight at many major stations and freight yards. However, since their introduction, the nature of rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed rakes of wagons and passenger trains are mostly multiple units, neither requiring the attention of a shunting locomotive. Consequently, a large proportion of the class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.As of 2011, around 100 locomotives remain working on industrial sidings and on the main British network. On heritage railways, they have become common, appearing on many of the preserved standard-gauge lines in Britain, with over 60 preserved.Digital control (DCC) has many advantages over the conventional DC control, however arguably the most dramatic bonus of operating DCC must be the advantages of Operating locomotives fitted with sound. How wonderfully alive can a layout become when sound can be heard from the locomotives? The more modern locomotives such as the Class 60, 56, 31 and even the ubiquitous 08, each of these classes have their own individual sound and are ready to play their part in adding audible realism to any DCC operated layout. All this is possible with Hornby Digital Sound fitted locomotives.

 on 2 Jan. 2013 // Bought this for my 8yr old son as a starting point to have a real train set and although the set is great once up and running it does feel as though its been made on the cheap. The track is of a good enough quality however the trains feel a bit plasticy and the slightest touch knocks them off the track which can be very frustrating especially when its so difficult to get them lined up on the tracks in the first place!Shame as hornby always made good products and although fun once you get going you do feel its alot of money for what it is, will persevere with it though for now just hope my son doesnt lose interest through its flaws. | Excellent. // 5.0 // 17 Dec. 2012 // By

H. Peppercorn took advantage of Thompson's retirement in 1946 to develop the design into the K1 Class. The K1 Class, which was made up of 70 locomotives, were all built in Glasgow at the North British Locomotive Company's Park Works over a 10 month period between May 1949 and March 1950. As was the North British Locomotive Company's all of the Class were sent to Eastfield shed, Glasgow for running in before being sent to England where they were used for both freight and express passenger workings. Thirty of the Class were sent to the Eastern Region while the remaining forty were dispatched to the North Eastern Region. Many of the North Eastern K1s were often seen as far North as Edinburgh and early on in their working life were regularly used on the West Highland line. A significant number of those allocated to the Eastern Region were based at March. All of the Class were fitted with electric lighting and self-cleaning smoke boxes identified with an SC plate situated just beneath the shed plate while some were fitted with AWS (Automatic Warning System). The first 50 K1 locomotives were outshopped in black with ""British Railways"" emblazoned on the tender while the remaining twenty were released with the early BR crest. From 1957 all of the Class received the BR emblem. As described the Class were used throughout the former LNER network as they were proven to be an incredible mixed traffic locomotive with each of the Class being paired with a 4200 gallon tender as used with the LNER/BR Class B1 locomotive. By 1958 the K1s were starting to be transferred from the Great Eastern Region with the result that by 1961 only eight remained at March, however by the middle of 1962 these had been moved to Retford and Doncaster. Withdrawal of the K1s began in December 1962 but it was a very slow demise as it took a full five years before the last locomotive, which was 62005 was withdrawn from service on the Eastern Region in 1967. Luckily 62005 survived into preservation and can be seen operating at the time of writing on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. K1 Class locomotive number 62059 was outshopped from the North British on the 13 December 1949. By 1950 the locomotive was on shed at 51G Haverton Hill where it remained until 1957 when 62059 could be seen on shed Ardsley and then later that year, Darlington. By March 1960 the locomotive was transferred to 51J Northallerton but was returned to Darlington in August of that same year. In February 1966, 62059 was rostered to 52F, Blyth (North) where it remained until withdrawal in February 1967.

 on 17 Jan. 2016 // Bagnall industrial locomotives are hardly represented in the model market.  This delightful loco is therefore very welcome!  It adds character to a layout and runs very well - with DCS I would expect it to perform superbly.As a model, it is slightly chunky and possibly a bit taller than original - but it is running on 00 track, so the purists have much to do anyway.  It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part.  Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design, so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis - but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available, proven option.  Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing 'skirts' to cover the wheels.  It will then much more resemble the prototype, at little cosmetic and no mechanical work.This is a great success at the ready to run stage, and forms a good base for detailing for the more advanced enthusiast.  Well done! | Five Stars // 5.0 // 6 Jan. 2016 // By

However when I received the letters they are green, blue, green, blue, red. Not the best mx of colours, I expected to receive one of each colour, but there is no yellow, the red letter on the end looks a bit odd. If I order again I would specify one of each colour. Also the letters on the carriages are not glued on they just come off which I had not expected.

 on 29 Dec. 2012 // My boys were desperate for these toys for Christmas and Santa didn't disappoint. They make really funny Ninja noises when chucked and thrown around and are very robust. However, there isn't very much you can do with them, so the novelty wears off quite quickly and then they are more like cuddly toys that end up in bed with the kids!Not sure I would recommend buying these toys. It was only a result of excellent advertising in early Autumn which led to my kids adding them to their list for Santa. Also, these toys need AAA batteries, which you need to buy, which is a pain. | For autistic friend // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2012 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Aug. 2014 // My son is Henry Hugglemonster mad and we already have both the Henry Hugglemonster Talking Henry 25cm Soft Toy and Henry Hugglemonster Talking Summer 25cm Soft Toy soft toys but his little baby sister is always trying to swipe them from him!  I noticed this little 15cm soft toy version of Summer and thought she would be ideal for my daughter and the fact that it was on offer at just a third of it's normal price basically sealed the deal. My problem now is that I gave it to her to play with bu now my son keeps swiping Summer from his sister!My son absolutely loves the Henry Hugglemonster television show on Disney Junior and it's the one show guaranteed to make him completely stop what he's doing and gaze with rapt fascination at the television with lots of smiles and giggles every couple of minutes when Henry or Summer sings or does something funny and my daughter is also transfixed whenever the programme is on too so a bit of a Henry Hugglemonster mad household here!The toy itself is lovely and soft and despite the conflicting age recommendations in the product description (in the main description it says from birth and in the technical details it says from 36 months) I think it is probably suitable from birth rather than 36 months as I can't see any small parts that could come off and be a danger to a baby as the eyes etc are all stitching as opposed to buttons/beads although there is no age confirmation on the label attached to the toy.Read more › | 00 it is such a good price as i have seen them in other shops ... // 5.0 // 26 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 6 Jan. 2012 // This little fox resembles it's (Gruffalo)character well.Would recommend to others. Looks great with the other gruffalo soft toys. It is better quality than the owl, but equally as good as the snake, mouse & gruffalo. | Size matters // 3.0 // 7 Jun. 2012 // By

 on 7 Jun. 2012 // This was a stocking filler for a child brought up on Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler. It's a faithful representation of the illustration, and is well put together. It's worth noting the size when purchasing, however, because 7"" isn't big for a stuffed toy. Maybe this is why it hasn't got nearly as much play time as we expected. Would I buy it again? No - I'd go for something bigger, without a doubt. | Gruffalo fox // 5.0 // 25 Aug. 2012 // By

 on 17 Feb. 2015 // I don't know what is this character - just bought it for my daughter since I liked the funny look. It's a decent toy, but I don't like 2 things. First of all, the  fox can't sit. Maybe I'm the lucky guy who has this toy in such flat state, but it looks like a few elephants slept on it. Nothing changed 2 weeks later, so maybe my fox is just disabled. Second thing is the difference in colour between the tail and the rest of this creature. They are so different that it feels like the tail comes from a different fox. All in all my daughter plays with it occasionally, so this is good enough. | Top fox // 5.0 // 2 Sept. 2015 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 15 May 2014 // Binky the Panda is one of 6 'join in and play' Blue Nose Friends. A medium sized toy, soft to the touch and very well made. If you have any problems with Binky and she won't talk then you probably haven't switched her on. There's a little on/off switch just above the battery compartment. If she still won't speak then change the batteries (3 x AAA).Binky's interactive and will chat to the other 'join in and play' characters. Sit Binky and friends close together, press a paw or squeeze their tummy and off they go. The toys are sensitive enough they know which of their interactive friends are close by and call one another by name. Only two in the group will speak though. They don't all talk at the same time.The more toys you have in the series the more phrases they use and the longer they chat. Unfortunately, they don't say much and each one has just a short series of phrases which they repeat over and over. They also don't have any facial movement and though their voices are slightly different there's no way of telling who's saying what unless you're really close by.It's worth bearing in mind their plush fabric can't be washed because of the battery pack. You can wipe them down with a damp cloth but I really wouldn't recommend these toys for serious rough and tumble play.Incredibly cute, my granddaughter loves them, but they are limited in what they say. | Charming chatting toy panda // 5.0 // 13 July 2014 // By

 on 13 July 2014 // A delightful toy - really does have a conversation with any other Blue Nose Friend but can just be played with on it's own when it will talk to it's owner!  Not too big for little hands.  Easy to make it talk and to change the batteries.  I had one small issue when it arrived as the batteries were flat but that was soon put right and Binky ready for my grandaughter to play with. | great // 5.0 // 12 April 2014 // By

The first film in the franchise was originally released on 25 May 1977, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, spawning two immediate sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released, again released at three-year intervals, with the final film released on 19 May 2005.Darth Vader is a fictional character and the central antagonist in the Star Wars saga, George Lucas' six-film science fiction saga. Vader originally appeared as the Empire's villainous enforcer in the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI), and as a tragic figure near the end of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the third and final film of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Lucas, in the audio commentary for Revenge of the Sith, says that he considers both trilogies together to be The Tragedy of Darth Vader.

 on 7 Jan. 2015 // I bought this as a 'companion' for my exuberantly affectionate male rabbit in an attempt to curb his endless advances on my feet.  He wasted no time on formal introductions and instantly took a shine to his classy new lady friend.On the off chance that this is not the standard purpose for buying a stuffed toy rabbit, I can also say that it seems well-made, is a good size and to a realistic scale (slightly smaller than my adult rabbit).  The fur material is soft, stuffing is plump and beans give a decent weight and the eyes don't look like they're going anywhere soon.It was realistic enough that people mistakenly thought it was real in a photo I posted of the toy in the rabbit cage.

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 27 Oct. 2015 // Hello...  I’m a very well behaved young bunny with a very soft silky coat which is just waiting for you to stroke me.  I have soft, gentle eyes which will look beseechingly into yours in the hope that you will pick me up and cuddle me, a snub nose with whiskers and quite a serious expression but with just the faintest hint of a bunny smile - I’m at that uncertain stage in my life where I don’t know where I’m going to be living or when this will be, but all I want is to be chosen and loved and make you or a child very happy.I am made from quality materials which a thick plush fur coat and Living Nature have a close eye for detail in giving me a thick plush fur coat on my body but shorter, denser fur on my ears.  I am very soft with my carefully stuffed body and have a few beans around my rear end to offer a different texture and add a little weight which makes me very huggable and squeezable too.  You have probably already noticed that I am very lifelike and from a distance I could possibly be mistaken for one of those other bunnies that run and hop around with their ears swinging.Regarding my vital statistics, I measure 28cm from the tip of my nose to the base of my soft, fluffy tail, my hind legs are 15cm apart and my head is 12cm above the ground.  I am child-safe but I would also be happy to play with adults too.  My lopped ears are silky soft with a shorter-pile fur on their underside but for some reason, they have been stitched close to my head by my breeder at ‘Living Nature’.  A quick snip of the stitch holding them down has released them enabling them to swing freely and much more naturally just as I see on my larger lagomorph relatives.Although I am a very well-bred bunny, I am not quite sure about my breed and would like to keep you guessing.Read more › | Beautiful toy rabbit // 5.0 // 21 Nov. 2012 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 24 May 2014 // My Blue Nose Friends are an off-shoot of the Me-To-You ""Tatty Ted"" range.""Leboo"" the Lion is lovely and soft to the touch.  His pastel yellow body, salt and pepper grey mane, grey patches, black eyes and whiskers and trademark blue mark nose.He is incredibly tactile and strangely calming to have in front of me.I found this lovely little lion in a local Thornton's but since his appearance on my desk at home he has attracted a lot of attention so I will have to get another so my godson can have his own and my own little lion can remain unmolested by my computer screen.I used to collect beany babies and buddies when I was a child and I was surprised to find out these little darlings have ""beans"" in their tummies too.""Leboo"" is number 126 in the Blue Nose Friends collection and was released in January 2014 - so, if like me, you are new to the series then finding the early ones may be a forlorn hope, but you never know your luck.I will admit that little ""Leboo"" has a placed in my heart and not just on my desk. | Great!! // 4.0 // 2 Feb. 2015 // By

 on 4 Nov. 2014 // Okay so for a start, the pug you actually receive looks nothing like the one on the picture. Mine was sitting down unlike this one and it was a whole lot smaller than what I expected after looking at the measurements provided in the description. Having said this, the dog is still very cute and probably just as nice as the one pictured so I wasn't too annoyed when it arrived looking rather different. It is very soft and I love the fact you can play online as you don't get this opportunity with most other soft toy purchases - a nice touch! So yeah bottom line is the pug is very cute and cuddly, just don't expect it to look the same as the picture shows, at least mine didn't anyway! | Gorgeous // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2013 // By

 on 7 Jan. 2013 // I bought two of these Steiff teddies for Christmas - one for a 1 year old and the other for a 2 year old.The girls seem to love them as they are small and very cuddly like a plush toy. But beware - I hadn't really appreciated how small 18cms is, so was disappointed when they arrived. So while they're probably a good size for small children they may not be so great for older ones.The other disappointing thing was the packaging - or lack of it. The teddies were in plastic bags (good idea while in a warehouse), so I had to find more suitable packaging (boxes) for presentation.I'm trusting Steiff to have produced something that's robust (my 29 year old still has his, which he was given at 1 year old), rather than just a collectors item - hence the 5 stars for durability. Only time will tell.I've marked ""fun"" and ""educational"" with 3 stars because a teddy probably doesn't deliver either of these in comparison to other toys.But it's a nice bear, well made and begs to be cuddled. | I was really disappointed to see one leg was a lot longer than ... // 2.0 // 7 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 5 Dec. 2015 // Let's be honest, choosing the right Despicable Me unicorn could make or break Christmas if your kids are as unicorn-mad as ours... and it's so hard to tell from the photos and description (and reviews!) which is the ""right"" one to choose.  The eagle-eyed parent might spot that some makes have ears and/or eyes that are more consistent with the movie, whilst other designs seem more or less fluffy... so we decided to choose fluffy over eye and ear accuracy and we are glad we did.  This unicorn is super soft and fluffy, much more like a typical soft pillow pets toy than say a Ty-style ""plush"" toy that tends to be firmer and more velvet texture than soft fluff... after all, you can hardly scream ""it's so FLUFFY!"" on Christmas morning if it's not fluffy!(For the record we bought ours from Kizrr - it looks exactly like the photo and it was posted from the UK by 1st class mail, excellent service! :-) | Perfect cuddly toy for kids! // 5.0 // 31 July 2015 // By

 on 22 Feb. 2013 // I just knew I had purchased a good looking 'doggie' for our godchild, when I saw a local pet shop displaying dog coats on this little fellow. (It still had it's Melissa & Doug label attached!)It was just so life like. The seven year old recipient was also delighted with her new 'pet' and has taken it around with her everywhere. Even her Mummy had trouble putting it down, it was so cute. I bought a puppy collar & lead for it, as I felt she would like that and made a blanket for it to sleep on, so I guess the new addition will be really 'at home' and taken care of, very well.So if you are thinking of a pet substitute for a child not allowed any, who might also have  allergies, I would recommend this very highly. It is not all soft and mushy, but has a very lifelike quality that a child over five would enjoy. | My new education assistant! // 5.0 // 7 Dec. 2013 // By

    Miss J L Goodman

 on 7 Dec. 2013 // As part of my job I visit schools to teach children about looking after dogs and staying safe around dogs (including greeting a dog appropriately and behaviour around dogs that are eating, in their bed, etc.). I had a border collie (of unknown brand!) helping me out, but poor Shep got a few holes in his belly and was bleeding polystyrene 'beans', plus was a bit bulky for getting on the bus, so he has now gone into retirement.Patch is the new pup, and is absolutely fantastic. My only concern is that being predominantly white he might get grubby, then I will have to test how well he washes up. But it is a very realistic Jack Russell size, shape and colour - he even has dark rings around his eyes - and I have been stopped and asked 'is that real?' even by adults - personally I think that, although realistic, it's still fairly obviously a toy! It has a very solidly stuffed body and a stiff wire frame, despite other reviews I find mine doesn't pose well and pings back into the standing shape but I am happy with that.If I'm nit picking one of the seams along a back paw wasn't finished properly, but it was such a tiny fault as to be unnoticeable.This is not really a toy to snuggle up in bed with, but if you are after a realistic looking toy dog you won't go far wrong with one of Melissa and Doug's. | Jack Russell // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2011 // By

 on 23 April 2015 // Imagine a teenager seeing a naked women for the first time - this is how my 1+ year old daughter reacts to dogs when she sees them. She has a few ""cartoony"" soft dogs, but none of them make her as happy as real dogs do. So it was a logical choice for me to buy a life-like soft toy and I must say the reaction was more than positive. She was playing with her a lot yesterday, so I'm happy. The dog itself is really nice - looks a lot like a real thing and the size is perfect. It seem to have a ""skeleton"", so it stands perfectly even when my daughter is hugging the creature. It's way better than a real dog for me - I like cats way more (and don't like pets in general), so the fact that I don't have to walk it out makes me happy. I also noticed that Melissa & Doug make a 1.2 meter tall giraffe - will probably buy one too. The quality is really good. | Companion for separation anxiety sufferer. // 5.0 // 20 Feb. 2016 // By

He also plays with it shaking it by the legs and will share his chair with it.  Considering the hard wear my dog puts it through it is still in very good condition, only needs a wipe over with a damp cloth to bring it up to new looking.

 on 1 Dec. 2015 // We first purchase the 32cm version from Amazon which was nothing like the photo shown either on Amazon or the Seiff website where the photo seems to be the same one for both sizes of bear. It looked smaller, thinner and not so attractive. We returned it immediately for an instant refund from Amazon which was very swift and efficiently handled.Having done a lot more research online we finally decided to order the 40cm version from Amazon not quite sure what we’d get.What we got was a better balanced and cuddly bear (than the 32cm) which was closer to the one shown in the photo, but looked like he’d grown up a bit. (see my photos) I can only think that the photo shown of Elmar on the Stiff and Amazon website is of an earlier version. The proportions are all wrong, most noticeably the eyes on the latest version are smaller, that said he is adorable and will be cherished by our new grandson. It just would be nice if he'd matched the picture.There are a number of comments about if the versions shown on Amazon are genuine as they come in a plastic bag, well they are, tagged and individually numbered so I have no doubt genuine Stiff. If you want the box (which doesn’t seem very exciting and is worth £3.95) buy your bear direct from Steiff.Overall height of bear sitting is 29cm, something we couldn’t find out anywhere.Also both the 32cm and 40cm versions have a bulge at the top of his neck, which apparently is normal. | A charming traditional toy // 4.0 // 6 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 6 Jun. 2014 // I bought this bear to celebrate the arrival of  the first baby of my wife's daughter who lives in Florence.  I chose this as a gift as a novelty as the traditional ""English teddy""  is unknown in Italy. I have never forgotten how I loved my Steiff teddy bear as a child. Mine must have been second hand as I grew up in England during WWII when there was no trade with Germany where these traditional toys have always been made by hand. I looked at several models in the Steiff range and selected this one as it is claimed to be machine washable, although I thought it rather expensive. All I can say at this stage is that the baby's mother fell in love with it at first sight - just like I did 70 years ago so what does the expense matter! | Absolutely charming! // 5.0 // 24 Sept. 2012 // By

Yes yes I know there are measurements there but purely because I didn't order it from this website, I didn't get to see those and going purely on the picture alone it looks quite big.The plush is cute and would be suitable for someone who enjoys the manga/anime series. However there is a warning on it that it 'contains small parts and not suitable for under 15s' ok....under 15s is a new one :D But yeah the little pieces could easily come off so I would be wary about giving it to a small child. | Great Death Note Plush // 5.0 // 4 Jan. 2015 // By
